What You Did
You integrated the MCP server for 10x with Visual Studio Code. You created a .github folder to include a Copilot instruction markdown file and a .vscode folder containing the mcp.json file, which holds the MCP server configuration.

What Worked
Configuring the mcp.json file effectively assisted in setting the context for the AI agent, enabling it to understand and execute commands more efficiently. The inclusion of tailored rules in your setup improved the interaction quality, leading to more relevant and accurate responses.

What Didn't Work
You faced challenges with certain rule configurations that did not yield expected behaviors. Troubleshooting involved iterating through various rule settings, testing modifications in isolation, and using debugging tools in VS Code to monitor AI responses and identify issues.

Insights Gained
Adjusting rules significantly influences the AI agent's behavior, aligning its responses more closely with your intent and expectations. The insights gained reveal how detailed configurations can guide the AI's decision-making process, enhancing its ability to understand context and provide relevant outputs. This experience emphasized the importance of precise tuning in achieving desired results.
